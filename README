This repository contains the files for two versions to the game, Simon Says.
To be used with a raspberry pi with the appropriate breadboard circuit attached.

simon_says.py: Can be run using ipython to begin playing the game. 

simon_says.sh: A shell version of the game which was used in the testing of 
the game logic.

Game instructions:
  The game will begin by flashing all the lights to signify the start of the game
  A light of a specific color will be flashed to the player
  The player will echo the same light back
  The game will continuously add a random light to the sequence such that 
    the user must remember increasingly longer sequences.
  If you fail, the lights will flash and a score will be printed to the console

Game logic:
  We implement the game as a while loop that maintains game state. While we 
  are still playing, the game functions between two game loops. The first
  reads the current sequence of lights to displays and flashes them in oder.
  The second will wait for user input and ensure that the player is pushing
  the correct buttons throughout the sequence.
